# RL_Pommerman
Pommerman is a play on Bomberman. There are three different variants, each of which follow the same basic idea but have their own distinct flavors: FFA: Free For All where four agents enter and one leaves. It tests planning, tactics, and cunning. The board is fully observable. Team (The NIPS '18 Competition environment): 2v2 where two teams of agents enter and one team wins. It tests planning, and tactics, and cooperation. The board is partially observable. Team Radio: Like team in that a it's a 2v2 game. Differences are that the agents each have a radio that they can use to convey 2 words from a dictionary of size 8 each step.
